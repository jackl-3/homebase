Alright, time to work with a new AI!

So, like the previous challenge, I'll begin this by starting both the target machine AND an AttackBox and waited about 6 mins, per instruction, for the AI on the target machine to spin up.

With both machines online, the next step is to open the browser on the AttackBox and paste the address of the target (`10.201.72.103`) into the address bar:

Oh? Well that's a good start. But I wonder if the AI will give me the rules if I ask it outright?

Hah nice! With that second and final response, I have the flag! Pretty easy!
